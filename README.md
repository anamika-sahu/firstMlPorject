# McKinsey Training - Constructing a Workflow in MLRun
This exercise will use the provided [Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data) and Python files to create a training and deployment pipeline. The pipeline will have 3 steps (data processing, model training, model deployment).

The three source code components are written for you, however it will be your job to use MLRun to containerize and orchestrate the components together into a larger pipeline (relevant links to documentation will be provided).
